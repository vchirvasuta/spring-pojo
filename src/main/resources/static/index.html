<p>When you create a new Spring Boot application, it includes some standard packages that are required to build a web application. These packages are:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code>com.example</code>: This is the base package of your Spring Boot application. It is recommended to replace <code>example</code> with a meaningful name for your application.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.config</code>: This package contains configuration classes for your application. You can use this package to define beans, configure Spring Security, or set up your application's properties.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.controller</code>: This package contains the controllers that handle incoming HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Each controller should be responsible for a specific resource or set of resources.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.model</code>: This package contains the domain models or entities that represent your application's data. You can use this package to define the attributes and behaviors of your domain objects.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.repository</code>: This package contains the repository interfaces that define how to interact with the database. You can use this package to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and custom queries.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.service</code>: This package contains the service layer that implements the business logic of your application. You can use this package to define the methods that manipulate the data and interact with the repository layer.</li>
    <li><code>com.example.exception</code>: This package contains the exception classes that handle exceptions and return error messages to the client.</li>
    <li><code>resources</code>: This is not a package, but a folder that contains configuration files, templates, static assets, and other resources. You can use this folder to store your application's properties, database scripts, HTML templates, and CSS files.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that you can customize these packages and folder structures to fit your application's needs. However, it is recommended to follow the standard convention to keep your code organized and maintainable.</p>
